# WikiWire

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> WikiWire is currently experimental. Please use cautiously and avoid potentially destructive configurations such as `sync_all` and consider testing your configurations with `dry_run`s first.

WikiWire is a GitHub Action that syncs files under `modules/` and `templates/` inside your Git repository into a live MediaWiki site via the [MediaWiki Action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Action_API). WikiWire allows for smooth automated workflows that make your GitHub repository the primary authority over your content and seem less like a backup.

WikiWire was developed by the Obby Wiki to streamline sharing modules across not only GitHub and MediaWiki, but also across multiple wikis. While complex, it is possible to transpile Luau to Lua 5.1 and upload it via this tool, as seen in [`obbywiki/modules`](https://github.com/obbywiki/modules).

# Compatibility

# How to use WikiWire

WikiWire is a CI action you can add to your repository's CI as a new workflow, or integrate it into an existing workflow. If you do not already store your modules and templates inside a Git repository such as `obbywiki/modules`, you will have to [create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) in order to use WikiWire.

## Required repository layout

To get started, ensure your repository matches the correct layout that WikiWire expects. Content will not be synced if neither a `modules/` nor a `templates/` folder is found in your repository.

```sh
.
├─ modules/
│  └─ mywikidomain.org/
│     └─ MyModule
│        └─ MyModule.module.lua
└─ wikiwire.toml
└─ .wikiwireignore
```

As seen above, WikiWire expects and *requires* that `modules/` and `templates/` are stored under the root level of the repository, or they will be ignored.

- **Modules:** `modules/<host|id>/<name>/...`
- **Templates:** `templates/<host|id>/<name>/...`

Ideally `<host|id>` is the site’s `host` in `wikiwire.toml`, but it can also be its `id` value if no `host` is set. Using the `host` value instead removes any ambiguity and is encouraged.

> [!TIP] 
> The `shared` key is a special key that can only be used as the shared directory when enabled in `wikiwire.toml`. 
> 
> Content under `modules/shared/` and `templates/shared/` are synced to **every** configured site. On-wiki titles are the same as for a single site (the `shared` segment is not part of the title). 
> 
> If the `shared` option is disabled or false in `wikiwire.toml`, the action will error when reading from `shared/`.
> 
> If you want to name a subfolder "shared" but don't want to trigger WikiWire, name the folder `_shared` instead. 
> Any path under `modules/` or `templates/` that contains a **path component starting with `_`** is skipped (not synced). Examples: `modules/_legacy/...`, `modules/example.com/MyModule/_draft/example.wikitext`, `modules/example.com/shared/_imported/...`.


An example from the ObbyWiki's repository structure:

```text
modules/obbywiki.com/GroupLink/GroupLink.module.lua
modules/obbywiki.com/GroupLink/doc.wikitext
modules/obbywiki.com/GroupLink/styles.css
modules/obbywiki.com/GroupLink/i18n/en.json
templates/obbywiki.com/Infobox/Infobox.template.wikitext
templates/obbywiki.com/MonthNav/MonthNav.template.wikitext
templates/obbywiki.com/MonthNav/styles.css
modules/shared/CommonUtil/CommonUtil.module.lua
```

You can see and use our live repository at https://github.com/obbywiki/modules for guidance.

## Configuring WikWire

Supplying a `wikiwire.toml` file under your repository is **required**. However, through action parameters, you can change that if required. To set up your first site, look below for the recommended beginner `wikiwire.toml` file:

```toml
# This is a global WikiWire configuration file, a CI action which automatically syncs and uploads modules and templates from a Git repo towards a production or upstream MediaWiki instance via bot passwords and the MediaWiki Action API.
# Learn more: https://github.com/obbywiki/wikiwire

version = 1
shared = false

[[sites]]
id = "mywiki"
host = "mywikidomain.org"
api = "https://mywikidomain.org/api.php"
default_branch = "main"
css_content_model = "css"
```

Replace each value with what matches your wiki and verify if `api.php` is reachable for bots. Your `api.php` file may be at `/w/api.php` or some other script path instead.

Next, for consistency, add a `.wikiwireignore` into the root of your repository. You can leave this blank, but you may need it later, so keep it around. You can also ignore Luau files this way:

```
**/*.module.luau
```

## Setting up the CI workflow

> [!NOTE]
> This section of the guide only applies to repositories on GitHub. Instead, if you are not on GitHub, you may have to research how to set up a CI workflow yourself.

Begin by adding a CI file at `.github/workflows/wikiwire.yml`. Then, paste the start template below into the contents and save them:

```yaml
name: WikiWire

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'modules/**'
      - 'modules/*'
      - 'templates/**'
      - 'templates/*'

jobs:
  wikiwire:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Sync files to production MediaWiki
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: obbywiki/wikiwire@latest # WikWire is pre-v1 software, consider tethering your workflow to the current latest release to avoid breaking changes
        with:
          username: WikiWireBot@BotPasswordNameHere # replace with your bot user and bot password
          password: ${{ secrets.WIKI_PASSWORD }}
          # dry_run: true # if you want to test your configs and routing first
```

This workflow assumes two things:

1. You have a user account named WikiWireBot on your wiki.
2. You have created a bot password for it and have supplied WIKI_PASSWORD to GitHub.

## How to setup a bot account and bot password

WikiWire requires a valid login in order to submit edits to your wiki.

Create a bot account on your wiki. Consider giving it the `bot` user group or even `sysop` (admin) permissions as they may be required to make edits quickly.

Next, navigate to `Special:BotPasswords` and create a bot password with the following permissions:

* Basic rights
* High-volume (bot) access
* Edit existing pages
* Edit protected pages
* Create, edit, and move pages

You may also optionally enable:

* Edit the MediaWiki namespace and sitewide/user JSON

Enable access for every IP address (0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0) as GitHub CI often rotates IP addresses.

After creating a user account and password, edit your existing workflow and update the `username` parameter. It should look something like this:

```yaml
username: UserAcccount@BotPasswordName
```

Next, upload your bot password as a secret into your GitHub repository. For help: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets

## Testing the workflow

After completing every step above, you should be ready to test WikiWire. Make any change to a module or a template and WikiWire should automatically sync it if everything is correct. To test your layout before actually syncing content, use the `dry_run` parameter.

If you are having trouble setting up WikiWire, use our repository as a guide: https://github.com/obbywiki/modules.

Some aspects such as Cloudflare's Bot Fight Mode can interfere with the Action API.

# Reference

## Errors

Most of the errors in WikiWire will be prefixed with a type.

* "WikiWire config error" -> an issue with your configuration only (wikiwire.toml, .wikiwireignore)
* "WikiWire API error" -> there was an issue contacting the MW API
* "WikiWire content model error" -> an error with a content model (e.g., a module not under modules/)

# WikiWire Specification

For additional details, see the specification here.

## Path to wiki title mapping

| Root | Repository path | Wiki title | Content model |
|------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| `modules` | `modules/<path_segment>/<root>/<root>.module.lua` | `Module:<root>` | `scribunto` |
| `modules` | `modules/<path_segment>/<root>/doc.wikitext` | `Module:<root>/doc` | `wikitext` |
| `modules` | `modules/<path_segment>/<root>/<any other path>` | `Module:<root>/<any other path>` | See below |
| `templates` | `templates/<path_segment>/<root>/<root>.template.wikitext` | `Template:<root>` | `wikitext` |
| `templates` | `templates/<path_segment>/<root>/doc.wikitext` | `Template:<root>/doc` | `wikitext` |
| `templates` | `templates/<path_segment>/<root>/<any other path>` | `Template:<root>/<any other path>` | See below |

Any other file under `modules/<path_segment>/<root>/` maps 1:1: the wiki subpage path is exactly the relative path under `<root>/`, including nested directories (for example `i18n/en.json` becomes `Module:GroupLink/i18n/en.json`).

The same 1:1 rule applies under `templates/<path_segment>/<root>/` for every path except the main `<root>.template.wikitext` (which maps to the bare `Template:<root>`) and `doc.wikitext` (which maps to `Template:<root>/doc`). For example `styles.css` becomes `Template:MonthNav/styles.css`.

Templates synced to `Template:` must live under `templates/`, not `modules/`. You can still use regular wikitext files under a template root like any other subpath.

Labels will be ignored on sync. Anything before the first colon (`:`) is considered a label (e.g., 'Label:Name' will simply be 'Name', which will then be synced to Module:Name because it is under the modules/ folder). This only counts for the first colon, and anything after will still be passed. This makes it easier to mark modules as imported while still syncing them.

### Content models (non-special files under `modules/`)

Suffix matching is ordered; the first match wins:

| Pattern | Content model |
|---------|----------------|
| `*.template.wikitext` | (invalid under `modules/`; the action will fail) |
| `*.module.lua` | `scribunto` |
| `*.module.luau` | `scribunto` |
| `*.wikitext` | `wikitext` |
| `*.css` | Per-site `css_content_model` in `wikiwire.toml` (default `sanitized-css`) |
| `*.json` | `json` |
| Anything else | Error: unsupported extension |

(**TODO**: these should be ignored instead, such as README.md)

### Content models (non-special files under `templates/`)

Suffix matching uses the same order as under `modules/`, with one restriction: `*.module.lua` and `*.module.luau` are invalid under `templates/` (Scribunto modules must live under `modules/`). The main page must be `<root>.template.wikitext` at `templates/<path_segment>/<root>/<root>.template.wikitext`.

| Pattern | Content model |
|---------|---------------|
| `*.module.lua` | (invalid under `templates/`; the action will fail) |
| `*.module.luau` | (invalid under `templates/`; the action will fail) |
| `*.wikitext` | `wikitext` |
| `*.css` | Per-site `css_content_model` in `wikiwire.toml` (default `sanitized-css`) |
| `*.json` | `json` |
| Anything else | Error: unsupported extension |

Some wikis may reject certain content models on `Template:` subpages; in that case the Action API returns an error, similar to unusual `Module:` subpages.


## Configuration: `wikiwire.toml`

Place at the repository root unless you override with the `config_path` action input.

**Did you know?** [The Better GitHub File Icons extension](https://github.com/wlft/browser-extensions-GitHubBetterFileIcons) supports wikiwire files! Both `wikiwire.toml` and `.wikiwireignore` will use the wikiwire logo!

### Top-level

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | integer | no | Config schema version; default `1`. Reserved for future use. |
| `shared` | boolean | no | If true, enables `modules/shared/` and `templates/shared/`, synced to every `[[sites]]` entry. Default false. |

### `[[sites]]` (repeatable)

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Stable site key (sessions, logs). Must be unique across rows. |
| `host` | string | no | Directory name under `modules/` and `templates/`. If omitted, defaults to `id`. Must be unique across sites. Cannot be `shared` when `shared = true` (that name is reserved). |
| `api` | string | yes | Full MediaWiki API URL, e.g. `https://example.org/w/api.php`. |
| `dry_run` | boolean | no | If true, only log planned edits; no `action=edit` requests for this site. |
| `default_branch` | string | no | If set, the action skips syncing when the workflow ref is not this branch (e.g. `refs/heads/main`). |
| `css_content_model` | string | no | Content model for `*.css` files under `modules/` and `templates/`. Default `sanitized-css`. Some wikis need `css`. |

Example:

```toml
# This is a global WikiWire configuration file, a CI action which automatically syncs and uploads modules and templates from a Git repo towards a production or upstream MediaWiki instance via bot passwords and the MediaWiki Action API.
# Learn more: https://github.com/obbywiki/wikiwire

version = 1
shared = true

[[sites]]
id = "obbywiki.com"
api = "https://obbywiki.com/w/api.php"

[[sites]]
id = "dev"
host = "dev.example.org"
api = "https://dev.example.org/w/api.php"
dry_run = true
default_branch = "main"
css_content_model = "css"
```

Credentials are **not** stored in this file. Use action inputs backed by secrets.

## `.wikiwireignore`

Optional file at the repository root (override with `ignore_path`). Patterns are relative to the repo root and follow **.gitignore** semantics (comments `#`, blank lines ignored; `**` and negation supported via the `ignore` package).

Ignored paths are skipped after change detection and never uploaded. Ignoring a path does **not** delete anything on the wiki.

Example:

```gitignore
# Legacy copies kept in git only
modules/obbywiki.com/ObbyGameInfobox/ObbyGameInfoboxLegacy.module.lua
modules/obbywiki.com/ObbyGameInfobox/ObbyGameInfoboxLegacy.template.wikitext
# It is recommended to include any file you don't want WikiWire to sync
**/*README.md
**/*requirements.txt
```

Please note that WikiWire is currently a BETA and this shouldn't be required in the future. Be advised that WikiWire doesn't support markdown or txt files, so syncing them will likely result in an error with-in your CI.

## GitHub Action inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `username` | no | `""` | Default bot username for sites not listed in `site_credentials`. With [Bot passwords](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Bot_passwords), use `UserName@BotPasswordName`. |
| `password` | no | `""` | Default bot password for sites not listed in `site_credentials`. |
| `site_credentials` | no | `""` | JSON object whose keys are site `id` values from `wikiwire.toml` (not `host`). Each value must be `{"username":"…","password":"…"}`. Overrides the global `username` / `password` for that site. Keys that do not match any configured site produce a workflow warning. |
| `config_path` | no | `wikiwire.toml` | Path to the TOML config. |
| `ignore_path` | no | `.wikiwireignore` | Path to the ignore file (may be missing). |
| `dry_run` | no | `false` | If `true`, no edits are sent (site-level `dry_run` in TOML still applies per site). |
| `sync_all` | no | `false` | If set to `'override'`, every file under `modules/` and `templates/` from the workspace will be synced instead of those that changes per-commit. Requires a prior checkout of the repo. Not recommended as this may potentially be destructive. Previously this parameter accepted `true`, but that was changed in v0.3.0 |

`dark_lua_compat` was removed in WikiWire v0.3.0, and supplying it as a parameter will produce an error.

Use a workflow `permissions` block with at least `contents: read` so the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` can call the compare API.

Every site that performs a real (non–dry-run) sync must resolve to a username and password: either the global inputs or a matching entry in `site_credentials`.

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: WikiWire

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'modules/**'
      - 'modules/*'
      - 'templates/**'
      - 'templates/*'

jobs:
  wikiwire:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Sync files to production MediaWiki
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: obbywiki/wikiwire@latest
        with:
          username: WikiWireBot@BotPasswordNameHere
          password: ${{ secrets.WIKI_PASSWORD }}
```

## Limitations

- **Deletes:** Removing a file from git does **not** delete the wiki page.
- **Renames:** Appear as delete + add; see deletes.
- **Initial push:** When GitHub sends an all-zero `before` SHA, the action uses the single `push` head commit’s file list instead of `compareCommits`.
- **Branches:** Use per-site `default_branch` or workflow `on.push.branches` to avoid syncing from unintended branches.

## Releases/Builds

Contributors to WikiWire must run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to build the `dist/index.js` release files via esbuild.
